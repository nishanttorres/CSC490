Medical marijuana back for another pass in North Carolina Senate
<break time="1s" />

The "compassionate care act" (Senate Bill 3) has gone through its first hearing in the North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill would allow for the prescription availability of cannabis for certain medical conditions, such as AIDS, HIV, ALS, and PTSD. It also outlines the process for licensing cannabis providers and where marijuana can be consumed while reinforcing the criminal charges that could be in place. The bill is not authorization for recreational marijuana. The sponsors remind that the bill is aimed at providing help to the people of North Carolina, and its only goal is to protect patients and their doctors from criminal charges and penalties. The bill is set to be heard again by the committee next Tuesday, where amendments are expected to be considered before a vote.

The Lakers won their game against the Pelicans with a score of 120 to 102, and James expressed his satisfaction with the performance of the new players.

The subversive Brilliance of Rihanna's Super Bowl Halftime Show
<break time="1s" />
Rihanna's Super Bowl LVII halftime show performance subverted expectations by featuring her visibily pregnant belly, which turned into a national guessing game for 13 minutes. The performance challenged the traditional expectations surrounding pregnant women's bodies and demonstrated that a woman who is confident, self-possessed, and pregnant can be just as spectacular and exciting as one who is naked. Rihanna's performance injected a mutinous amount of estrogen into one of the most testosterone-fueled events of the American calender, drawing in more viewers than the game itself. Her performance showed that toughness comes in many forms, including the ability to create a new human being.
