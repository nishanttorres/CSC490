        "content": "Should universities require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before attending campus once vaccines are readily available in Australia?\n\nProfessor Iain Martin, vice-chancellor of Deakin University and former dean of the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland, says yes.\n\nCampus life is filled with potential super-spreader events. Students attend lectures, seminars, social events and industry functions.\n\nRead more: 'Campus covid' was as inevitable as freshers' flu \u2013 here's how universities can look after their students\n\nStudent immunisation and screening requirements existed for certain courses before the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccinations are now required for students in certain circumstances. They include those who enter premises that have government-driven mandatory vaccination requirements, such as restricted vulnerable facilities. Examples include hospitals, residential aged care, disability accommodation services and correctional centres.\n\nUntil now, Australian universities have not sought to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all students. However, Martin says:\n\nIn response, National Union of Students president Zoe Ranganathan accepted the importance of vaccinations, but called for a less \u201cpunitive\u201d approach.\n\nIn Canada, some have suggested mandatory vaccinations should apply only to students on campus. Those who refuse to get vaccinated \u201cshould be offered online alternatives\u201d.\n\nRead more: Mandatory COVID-19 vaccines on university campuses: An obvious solution or a problem?\n\nUniversities also need to consider their duty to staff. There are work health and safety implications of permitting unvaccinated students to potentially bring COVID-19 to campus.\n\nVaccination \u201csignificantly reduces the risk of getting COVID-19 from all known variants\u201d. Thus, it will reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading on campus.\n\nBecause of their age, most university students have been less vulnerable to COVID-19. However, new variants of the virus are increasing the risk to people of all ages.\n\nAnd not every university student has robust health. Staff and students can have disabilities or medical conditions that make them unable to be vaccinated or especially vulnerable if they catch the virus.\n\nUniversities should take steps to ensure vulnerable members of their community are not exposed to COVID-19 on campus. Mandatory vaccination is one way to ensure this.\n\nRead more: No big packed lectures allowed if we're to safely bring uni students back to campus\n\nUniversity leadership must balance public health and opinion, along with the risk of permitting potentially unsafe students onto campus. It appears an overwhelming number of Australians support mandatory vaccines. Researchers at the universities of Sydney and Western Australia found three-quarters of Australians would support a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy for travel, study and work.\n\nAnother consideration for universities is international students, whose fees subsidise affordable public education and research and innovation. Prior to COVID-19, 32% of university students in Australia were full-fee-paying international students. International students also bring in billions to the Australian economy.\n\nRead more: As hopes of international students' return fade, closed borders could cost $20bn a year in 2022 \u2013 half the sector's value\n\nWhereas Australia has until now been largely free from COVID-19, many countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America have been hit hard by the pandemic. If Australia is to open up to students from these countries, mandatory vaccinations will make Australia a safer destination and more attractive for a customer base who have lived through a nightmare.\n\nA recent IDP Connect survey found an overwhelming majority of international students were already vaccinated or willing to be vaccinated to return to campuses.\n\nThus, both the economic and public health grounds for mandatory vaccination of students on campus are compelling.\n\nRead more: Australia's international education market share is shrinking fast. Recovery depends on unis offering students a better deal\n\nWhile the mandatory vaccination debate is new in Australian universities, it has attracted more attention overseas.\n\nIn Canada some universities, including Ottawa and Toronto, are mandating vaccinations. Others, such as the University of Calgary, are being criticised for not mandating vaccinations for students before they attend class.\n\nOver 730 colleges in the United States have made vaccination mandatory. These universities include Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, UCLA, and Yale.\n\nRead more: Campus outbreaks of COVID-19 were almost guaranteed\n\nThe US mandates have led to unsuccessful legal challenges. Students challenged Indiana University\u2019s mandatory vaccination policy, claiming it interfered with their due process rights to bodily integrity. In August 2021, US Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett rejected the students\u2019 request for emergency relief.\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had unanimously declined to issue an injunction while the students\u2019 appeal moved forward to the Supreme Court. The appeals court noted:\n\nThe authors would like to recognise the support of Georgia Atcheson.",

        "content": "Louise McSharry has shared a glimpse of her recent home renovation \u2014 and it\u2019s a huge thumbs up from the RTE DJ\u2019s Instagram followers.\n\nLouise has lived in her Dublin home with husband Gordon and sons Sam and Ted for seven years, but said the property had \u2018never really felt like me\u2019.\n\nShe was eager to freshen up what she described as a \u2018magnolia\u2019 box and has now made over her kitchen and dining room as part of a collaboration with paint makers Dulux.\n\n\u2018While magnolia has a time and place, I desperately wanted some colour on the walls and to make it feel more zoned,\u2019 she wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe refreshed room has now been \u2018zoned\u2019 using contrasting colours, with each area designed for different functions.\n\nThe area behind (and above) the dining table has been painted in denim blue, standing out from the rest of the room, which has been done in a refreshing peach colour.\n\n\u2018It makes that feel like a section and I love it. I think it will also be a perfect frame for our art,\u2019 Louise said of the blue.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m obsessed with this peach colour which changes throughout the day, as I type it looks much paler than it appears in this picture.\n\n\u2018Gordon says it reminds him of that beautiful light that comes in the window at sunrise and sunset and I think he\u2019s exactly right. I\u2019d honestly paint my entire house with it!\u2019\n\nThe likes of Thalia Heffernan and Tara Stewart joined Louise\u2019s followers in admiring the new look, so it\u2019s definitely a job well done.",

        "content": "In the 87th minute of the Women\u2019s International Champions Cup championship against French club Olympique Lyonnais, Morgan Weaver made a run that proved to be the difference-maker.\n\nShe collected the ball from Christen Westphal from within the box while Lyon's keeper misread the ball placement, allowing the former No. 2 overall pick to sneak the ball in the far, bottom corner of the net.\n\nWeaver had subbed onto the pitch in the 82nd minute in her first action since missing extended time with an injury. Five minutes later, she earned the breakthrough and eventual game-winner.\n\n\"I think it's just the mentality that everyone has on this team that we want to win,\" Weaver said. \"If it's your moment it's your moment, and if it's not, you're still in the moment with the team, and that's all that really matters.\"\n\nWith the win, Portland became the second United States club team to win the Women\u2019s ICC tournament. In fact, this was the first time Thorns FC played a European club in its history.\n\nWhen the club hoisted the WICC trophy at Providence Park, it was the sixth trophy in franchise history and second in 2021 alone.\n\nCrystal Dunn, Lindsey Horan, and Christine Sinclair all made their first appearances since returning from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics as second half substitutes.\n\nNext, it's back to NWSL play with Portland hosting NJ/NY Gotham FC at Providence Park at 7:30 p.m. PST on Wednesday, August 25th.",

        "content": "There have only been two preseason games, both against backup defenses, but Wilson continues to check all the boxes. He\u2019s been the most productive of the five first-round rookie quarterbacks thus far and doesn\u2019t look fazed by the overall speed of the game. He\u2019s 5-for-5 for 94 yards on throws 10-plus yards down the field this preseason. It might be easy to overreact in August, but it\u2019s hard not to get excited by the kid.\n\nThe Jets made a splash this offseason, signing Corey Davis to a three-year, $37.5M deal. Through two preseason games, it\u2019s clear his workload is going to reflect that salary. Davis is unabashedly the number one wide receiver in New York.\n\nMore than half of Wilson\u2019s targets went his way on Saturday, which he parlayed into four catches for 70 yards. The Jets have unleashed the full route tree early, too. Just yesterday, Davis was targeted on a bubble screen, a post, a curl, a short out, a crossing route and a double move. He\u2019s been the premier target on third downs as well. Elijah Moore has dazzled in training camp and hasn\u2019t played in either preseason game, but it\u2019s hard to imagine he\u2019ll be able to usurp Davis as Wilson\u2019s top target.\n\nIt was Kroft, however, not Davis, that was the recipient of both touchdown passes on Saturday. The newly-signed tight end from the Buffalo Bills has been taking first-team snaps throughout camp and finally showed what his role can be at its best in this offense. He made a great catch in the seam and held onto the ball through contact for the first touchdown from 18 yards out. On the very next drive, he caught a short pass and made a man miss before plowing his way in for the score. Kroft is already a better blocker than Chris Herndon, and his performance in the passing game yesterday likely supplanted his status as the top tight end on the roster.\n\nThe Packers sat 32 players yesterday, including all of their offensive starters. Aaron Rodgers and Jordan Love were among the 32. So when Green Bay trotted out Kurt Benkert at quarterback, things figured to be a cake walk for the Jets starting defense. Instead, Benkert and the backup offense marched right down the field on two of their first three drives for touchdowns. AJ Dillon had his way in the run game, rushing four times for 28 yards. Malik Taylor caught four passes for 66 yards. There were missed tackles, penalties and four-man rushes that didn\u2019t sniff the pocket.\n\nStill, the Jets\u2019 starting unit was missing quite a few pieces due to injury. Lawson is done for the year, but Quinnen Williams, Sheldon Rankins, Blessuan Austin and Vinny Curry all missed Saturday\u2019s game due to injury. Lamarcus Joyner didn\u2019t play for personal reasons. Jarrad Davis suffered an ankle injury in the second quarter. Isaiah Dunn and Tanzel Smart were forced into starting reps and struggled to hold their own. Things are going to get better as this group gets healthier. The backups pitching a shutout in the second half should earn some guys more playing time and patch up some of the holes. But if this defense is going to be competitive after losing Lawson, Saleh is going to have to work some magic.",

        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va., Aug. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Salvation Army is activating its Emergency Disaster Services personnel to meet the immediate needs of survivors and first responders affected by Tropical Storm Henri, which made landfall on August 22 in along the south coast of Rhode Island.\n\n\"We are doing everything in our power to respond efficiently and effectively to the impacts made by Tropical Storm Henri,\" said Emergency Disaster Services Coordinator of The Salvation Army's USA Eastern Territory, Robert Myers III. \"With the continued generosity of the public, The Salvation Army will remain on the ground serving those affected by the storm for however long our services are needed.\"\n\nIn addition to high winds, Henri is expected to bring heavy, sustained rain and storm surge that could create severe flooding conditions. This could limit the ability for relief teams to reach those in need, including sustained water damage to structures that obstruct access to impacted areas.\n\nAs a community-based organization, The Salvation Army is uniquely positioned to respond with in-depth understanding of the area's needs. In preparation for response efforts, several steps have been taken to serve those impacted:\n\u2022 Incident Command centers have been established in and .\n\u2022 Mobile feeding units are being prepared for deployment to serve food, drinks, and emotional and spiritual care to survivors and first responders.\n\u2022 Each mobile feeding unit can serve 500 to 1,500 meals per day.\n\u2022 Fixed Corps locations are being prepared to provide feeding and other needed support to those affected.\n\nIn addition, Salvation Army disaster personnel are collaborating with federal, state, and local emergency management agencies and other partners to respond to and monitor ongoing impacts and evolve response efforts as needed.\n\nThe storm comes at the beginning of what is predicted to be a busy hurricane season. In light of the pandemic, The Salvation Army has evolved service delivery with extra precautions such as social distancing at food distribution sites, adapted feeding models and updated personal protective equipment requirements.\n\nA digital media kit with current and historical Emergency Disaster Services assets can be found here.\n\nFor more information on The Salvation Army's continued response, visit salvationarmyusa.org or disaster.salvationarmyusa.org.\n\nTo make a financial gift to support ongoing disaster relief efforts:\n\nThe Salvation Army annually helps 30 million Americans overcome poverty, addiction, and economic hardships through a range of social services. By providing food for the hungry, emergency relief for disaster survivors, rehabilitation for those suffering from drug and alcohol abuse, and clothing and shelter for people in need, The Salvation Army is doing the most good at 7,600 centers of operation around the country. During times of disaster, 100 percent of designated donations to The Salvation Army are used for immediate response and long-term efforts. In the first-ever listing of \"America's Favorite Charities\" by The Chronicle of Philanthropy, The Salvation Army ranked as the country's largest privately funded, direct-service nonprofit.

        "description": "Kat Cammack Jabs Pelosi Over Naive Response to Afghanistan Debacle  The Floridian",
        "content": "As the Biden Administration has seemingly accepted the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan, Republican congressional members have had a field day with bashing Biden over the Afghan debacle, including US Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL), who is going after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her responsibility in the chaos.\n\nIn a recent interview with Fox News, Cammack disclosed details of a meeting she attended with Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of State Blinken, and General Milley. Speaker Pelosi was reportedly vocal in the Q&A portion of the meeting, saying of the Americans left behind in Afghanistan, \u201cEverything sounds like it\u2019s in a good place. Everyone just needs to get to the airport.\u201d\n\nCammack told Fox that it \u201cspeaks volumes of not just the administration, and how they handled this utter, total failure, but Democrat leadership in general,\u201d adding that \u201cWhen the Speaker of the House is saying that \u2018Everything should be in a good place, everybody just needs to get to the airport\u2019 it took me about 10 minutes just to get my jaw up off the desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that when we have left Americans behind, when we have one of the worst examples of an American military failure, no contingency plans in place, and the Speaker of the House is saying \u2018everything seems fine\u2019 Madam Speaker, you can\u2019t just take an Uber to the airport! Not a casual stroll through the street\u201d stated Rep. Cammack on Rep. Pelosi.\n\nCammack also commented on the mixed messaging over the current status of the region, claiming that some sources are telling people to stay in place while mainstream media has been naive about the threat posed by the Taliban.\n\nCammack reported that her office is working on getting 187 Americans home, and they are just from Florida\u2019s third congressional district alone.\n\nHowever, according to Cammack, the State Department is still telling Americans to go to the airport .\u201d You wanna talk about mixed messaging,\u201d concluded Cammack",

Kat Cammack (R-FL), who is going after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her responsibility in the chaos. Everyone just needs to get to the airport.\u201d\n\nCammack told Fox that it \u201cspeaks volumes of not just the administration, and how they handled this utter, total failure, but Democrat leadership in general,\u201d adding that \u201cWhen the Speaker of the House is saying that \u2018Everything should be in a good place, everybody just needs to get to the airport\u2019 it took me about 10 minutes just to get my jaw up off the desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that when we have left Americans behind, when we have one of the worst examples of an American military failure, no contingency plans in place, and the Speaker of the House is saying \u2018everything seems fine\u2019 Madam Speaker, you can\u2019t just take an Uber to the airport! Not a casual stroll through the street\u201d stated Rep. Cammack on Rep. Pelosi. \n\nCammack also commented on the mixed messaging over the current status of the region, claiming that some sources are telling people to stay in place while mainstream media has been naive about the threat posed by the Taliban.\n\nCammack reported that her office is working on getting 187 Americans home, and they are just from Florida\u2019s third congressional district alone.\n\nHowever, according to Cammack, the State Department is still telling Americans to go to the airport .\u201d",
