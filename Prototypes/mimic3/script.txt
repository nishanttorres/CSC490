Medical marijuana back for another pass in North Carolina Senate
<break time="1s" />

The "compassionate care act" (Senate Bill 3) has gone through its first hearing in the North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill would allow for the prescription availability of cannabis for certain medical conditions, such as aids, HIV, ALS, and PTSD. It also outlines the process for licensing cannabis providers and where marijuana can be consumed while reinforcing the criminal charges that could be in place. The bill is not authorization for recreational marijuana. The sponsors remind that the bill is aimed at providing help to the people of North Carolina, and its only goal is to protect patients and their doctors from criminal charges and penalties. The bill is set to be heard again by the committee next Tuesday, where amendments are expected to be considered before a vote.
