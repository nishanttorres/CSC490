# In order to run the front-end you need to download some dependencies:

wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

Installing node.js

nvm install 18.14.2 or whatever version you want

Once complete you can change your cwd to news-sythesizer-jsx 
download the necessary dependencies by typing:

npm install

It should automatically download all the dependecies. 
If you want to download them separately you can use the following commands:

npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by <br />
npm install --save react-multi-date-picker <br />
npm i --save react-select<br /> 
npm install react-select-country-list --save<br />
<br />

After you are done, you can start the front-end by typing

npm start on the cli
