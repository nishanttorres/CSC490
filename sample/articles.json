        "title": "Livingston boss set for sleepless night after dismal display at St Mirren",
        "description": "The Lions failed to roar as they fell to a 3-0 loss against the Buddies that included giving away a penalty in the first few seconds of the game.",
        "content": "Livingston boss David Martindale admitted the entire squad and coaching staff will have a sleepless night trying to digest their woeful display in a 3-0 away loss to St Mirren this afternoon.\n\nThe contest got off to the worst possible start for the Lions as they conceded a penalty inside the opening seconds when Luiy de Lucas was ruled to have handled. Mark O'Hara slotted home from the spot and it wasn't until the after the break that the visitors seemed to get to grips with the game.\n\nBy that time, they were already down and out after Tony Watt was allowed to tap home on 18 minutes before O'Hara converted a second spot-kick - this time for a Jason Holt handball - just before the interval.\n\nLivi did at least offer some threat after that with Andrew Shinnie seeing an effort bounce off the bar and post while Joel Nouble and Nicky Devlin passed up chances in the second-half. Martindale also felt his side should have been awarded a penalty for an apparent trip on Stephen Kelly.\n\nThe defeat takes the Lions outside of the top six with three games remaining but while Martindale admitted it will be a tough night, he's determined to put it bed quickly.\n\nHe commented: \"Every single one of us won\u2019t get to sleep tonight. We\u2019ll get to sleep about 3am and wake up at 7am and that four hours will be broken because all you\u2019re doing is thinking about the game. I know that\u2019s how my night is going to go and I\u2019d like to hope everyone is feeling very similar.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m very big on letting it go once you\u2019re in the building. I can\u2019t change what happened today - none of us can. So we have to focus on the next game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in this together. I maybe got the team shape wrong and parts of the team selection wrong but if you disect the game down - it\u2019s two penalties. I can\u2019t coach that - that isn\u2019t down to formations or personnel.\n\n\u201cThe players who gave the penalties away have been playing very well. We need to all own this and feel down and take responsibility but once we analyse it on Monday it gets put to bed.\"\n\nHe added: \"The goals were two penalties and a shot because of our defending. I\u2019m hugely disappointed about the manner of the goals we lost. They were cheap and we didn\u2019t give ourselves any opportunity.\n\n\"We let ourselves down in the way we defended our own area and we won\u2019t get anywhere in football playing the way we did in the first half. There\u2019s not many teams give a penalty away in the first few seconds of a game.\n\n\"We lost a second goal from a quick throw-in then a third from a penalty again. I don\u2019t know how you jump without using your arms but I\u2019ve come to accept it and in the modern day they\u2019re probably both penalties.\n\n\"I just hope we start getting them and I think we had a decent claim for one when Stephen Kelly was fouled. We\u2019d a legitimate goal from Andrew Shinnie in the first half which St Mirren players say was in. So I\u2019m a bit disappointed about that. It would\u2019ve given us something to come out for.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had one foot in the top six and never taken the opportunity to cement our place in it. But it\u2019s still all to play for.\u201d\n\nDon't miss the latest news from the West Lothian Courier. Sign up to our free newsletter here",

        "content": "Last updated on .From the section Scotland\n\nCraig McIsaac's goal after just 12 seconds fired Newtonmore to a 3-0 home win over Kyles in the Mowi Premiership.\n\nThe two highest-scoring games in the reserve team championship, the HIS Sutherland Cup, produced 31 goals - and two clean sheets.\n\nIain Robinson and Connor Jones, both in the second half, followed up McIsaac's lightning start for Newtonmore.\n\nFinlay MacLennan opened for Beauly and Mid Argyll's Chris Hollysong sent the teams in level at half time. Jack MacDonald, with a penalty, and Robbie Brindle then tied up the points for Beauly.\n\nCraig Morrison got a familiar opener for Caberfeidh, but Malcolm Clark soon equalised. Daniel MacVicar and Louis MacFarlane put Camanachd well in command in the second half and, although Morrison struck again late on, there was still time for Matthew Sloss to score Camanachd's fourth.\n\nThere was only quarter of an hour left at Kiltarlity when Marc MacLachlan got the breakthrough for Lovat.\n\nNeale Reid, with six goals, headed a list of six Glenurquhart scorers in their 16-0 Sutherland Cup eclipse of local rivals Strathglass at Cannich.\n\nMeanwhile, eight players, including Robert Shiels with four, found the net in Kingussie's 15-0 annihilation of visitors Inverness.\n\nThe two National Division pace setters both extended their 100% records to three games with home wins - Kilmallie 4-1 against Col Glen and Lochaber 3-1 over Oban Celtic.",

        "title": "NBA and players\u2019 union reach pact on new seven-year labor agreement",
        "description": "The agreement on a new CBA means the most financially successful era in NBA history will continue uninterrupted for at least six more years",
        "content": "The most financially successful era in NBA history will continue uninterrupted for at least six more years, after the league and its players came to a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement that will kick in this summer.\n\nIt took more than a year of bargaining, with the intensity and expectation growing in recent days, and the handshake agreement was struck in the wee hours of Saturday morning \u2013 shortly after the league intended to tell the National Basketball Players Association of its plan to opt out of the current CBA on 30 June.\n\nInstead, a deal got done, at least in principle. \u201cThe NBA and National Basketball Players Association have reached a tentative agreement on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement, pending ratification by players and team governors,\u201d was the league\u2019s only comment, coming shortly before 3am Eastern.\n\nTechnically, it will be a seven-year deal, though either side can opt out a year early \u2013 meaning labor peace is only assured through the 2028-29 season. It will also begin the era of an in-season tournament, something NBA commissioner Adam Silver has wanted for years.\n\nBarring a change to the current plan, teams will be given an 80-game schedule for next season in August. Those 80 games will include \u201ctournament\u201d games \u2013 probably four \u2013 that will count in regular-season standings. All teams will have two more games added to their schedule eventually so the full 82-game slate is played; the two teams that make the tournament final will be playing an 83rd game that won\u2019t count in the standings.\n\nAmong other details, per a person familiar with the negotiations who spoke to the Associated Press: players will generally have to appear in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for the top individual awards such as Most Valuable Player; the maximum value of contract extensions will rise; and a third two-way contract will now be available to teams \u2014 which could potentially see roster sizes grow from 17 to 18. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the National Basketball Players Association released specifics publicly.\n\nAnother new part of the CBA will be a second luxury tax level that, when reached, will keep teams from using their midlevel exception to sign players. That was a clear compromise, given how some teams wanted the so-called \u201cupper spending limit\u201d that would have essentially installed an absolute ceiling on what can be spent each season and help balance the playing field between the teams that are willing to pay enormous tax bills \u2013 like the reigning NBA champion Golden State Warriors \u2013 and those who aren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cPlayers lose again ... Middle and Lower spectrum teams don\u2019t spend because they don\u2019t want to,\u201d Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green posted to Twitter. \u201cThey want to lose. So increase their spending capabilities, just to increase them. They continue to cut out the middle. And this is what we rushed into a deal for?\u201d\n\nThe new CBA won\u2019t include a return to the policy that would allow high school players to enter the NBA draft. It was discussed and has been an agenda item for months, but the rule won\u2019t be changing anytime soon \u2013 probably not for at least the term of the next CBA.\n\n\u201cWe also appreciate that there is a lot of benefit to really having veterans who can bring those 18-year-olds along,\u201d NBPA executive director Tamika Tremaglio said in February during an NBPA news conference at All-Star weekend. \u201cAnd so, certainly anything that we would even consider, to be quite honest, would have to include a component that would allow veterans to be a part of it as well.\u201d\n\nSilver said Wednesday, at the conclusion of a two-day Board of Governors meeting, that he was hopeful of getting a deal done by the weekend \u2013 a clear positive sign. The current CBA, which took effect 1 July 2017, came with a mutual option for either the NBA or the NBPA to opt out after six seasons, or 30 June of this year.\n\nSaturday\u2019s agreement doesn\u2019t end the process, though it\u2019s obviously a huge step forward.\n\nThe owners will have to vote on what the negotiators have hammered out, and the players will have to vote to approve the deal as well. Then comes the actual writing of the document \u2013 the most recent CBA checked in at around 600 pages containing nearly 5,000 paragraphs and 200,000 words. Much of it will be the same; much of it will need revising.\n\nAnd while these talks went on for more than a year, this is the second consecutive CBA to be negotiated without the dysfunction that accompanied the talks in 2011 \u2013 when the league wound up locking out players for 161 days and had to eventually shorten the 2011-12 season from 82 to 66 games.\n\nThere was no appetite for a work stoppage, not after a 2021-22 season in which the NBA revenue topping $10bn for the first time and basketball-related income reaching $8.9bn, another record. Silver said the NBA is on pace this season for more sold-out games than ever before.",

        "summary": "The NBA and players' union have reached a tentative agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement that will kick in this summer, with an 80-game schedule for next season in August and 80 tournaments for the next two seasons. The agreement includes a seven-year deal, though either side can opt out a year early, and a third two-way contract will now be available to teams. Players will have to appear in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for the top individual awards such as Most Valuable Player; the maximum value of contract extensions will rise; and a second luxury tax level that, when reached, will keep teams from using their midlevel exception to sign players. The new CBA won't include a return to the policy that would allow high school players to enter the NBA draft. The owners have to vote on the deal by the weekend, and the deal is expected to be approved by the board of Governors.",

        "description": "24-year-old made return from injury but could not get off the bench",
        "content": "The 24-year-old returned after a month out from a pubic bone injury to make the bench but wasn\u2019t called upon as Ollie Watkins and John McGinn secured the victory at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIn the backdrop of his increasing exile are stagnant contract negotiations that have led to talk of a move away to Liverpool, Manchester United or Bayern Munich.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Potter explained why he didn\u2019t look to Mount to turn the match: \u201cWith Mason, I just felt we were there in the game.\n\n\u201cWe made some attacking subs and wanted to see how it all landed. Mason is coming back and only had a couple of days training.\n\nPotter went on to explain why he picked Marc Cucurella and Reece James as centre-backs, two players who typically prefer to play at full back, adding: \u201cWe wanted to attack, we wanted to use Marc and Reece as two laterals, that\u2019s where the space would be and they can construct attacks well.\n\n\u201cI thought we got some good opportunities from an attacking perspective, won the ball back, high as well. I think we had a 1v1 with Mischa [Mudryk] a couple of times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an error for the first goal and whenever there\u2019s an error there\u2019s always something you can do better.\u201d\n\nHe also confirmed that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Hakim Ziyech, Denis Zakaria and David Datro Fofana were all simply left out of his squad, only Edouard Mendy not making it through injury.\n\nMeanwhile, he pointed to the fact his side had 27 shots on Saturday but couldn\u2019t score, their most attempts without netting in a league match since 2014.\n\nWith so many chances created and wasted, Potter didn\u2019t doubt his players\u2019 effort on Saturday night: \u201cIf you look at the stats of the game, apart from the most important stat, there\u2019s a lot there that says we did a lot well but ultimately the two boxes are the most important area and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve come up short.\n\n\u201cFirst half I thought we had a couple of opportunities, we won it back high and created a 1v1 situation pretty early in the game.\n\n\u201cObviously the goal is a blow for us. We need to do better than that. Of course, it\u2019s difficult then, you\u2019re 1-0 down at home. I thought the team gave everything, I thought the intention of the team was there.\n\n\u201cYou could tell by the amount of times we got in their box, the shots we had, there was a positive intent but the scoreline is painful for us.\u201d",

        "content": "talkSPORT host and West Ham season ticket holder Mark Webster takes a (nervous) look at the clash with Southampton\n\nThe practical jokes are out of the way, we can all move on to the showers part of April.\n\nWhich as far as West Ham are concerned, is actually more a case of it never rains, but it pours. The crazy nature of this season, coupled with another run into European competition, means the Hammers have a jam packed four weeks of nine games ahead of them.\n\nAnd that Europa League Cup campaign, coupled with a pack-of-dogs fight at the bottom of the table, means each match will be as crucial as the next. Starting today, when the Saints come marching into the London Stadium for a relegation thriller.\n\nOf course, battling on two fronts had become quite the thing for David Moyes\u2019 team during his second spell at the club. However, chasing down a top six or seven finish is clearly much more fun than trying to stay in the Premier League.\n\nAs the team have frequently proved with their dogged attempts to get precious points by any means necessary. It\u2019s not always been pretty, and most worrying for us Hammers fans, it\u2019s also not always been effective.\n\nWhich perversely enough, is at odds with the freedom with which they\u2019ve basically cruised into the quarter-final stages of the Europa League.\n\nIn which lies much of the frustration over Stratford way. For us in the stands and, I can easily imagine, for those down on the shopfloor. Just how are these players putting in performances that are in such stark contrast?\n\nWell, the answer\u2019s simple really isn\u2019t it? Pressure. On both individual players, and a manager who has to help those individuals become a cohesive group again.\n\nAnd that pressure will not have been particularly eased after Saturday\u2019s results. With Bournemouth and Crystal Palace getting late wins, and Nottingham Forest and Wolves drawing.\n\n\n\nIt leaves West Ham second from bottom, but also three points from 14th. So everyone of us of the claret and blue persuasion will be hoping they can start April the way they mean to carry on.\n\n\n\nAnd not as a complete April shower.",

Despite this, the pressure will be on both individual players and a manager to help them become a cohesive group again, and that pressure will not have been eased after Saturday's results.

        "content": "1 April 2023; Ryan Baird of Leinster scores his side's first try during the Heineken Champions Cup Round of 16 match between Leinster and Ulster at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Photo by Harry Murphy/Sportsfile \u2014 \u00a9 SPORTSFILE\n\nUlster\u2019s European dream is over after they were beaten 30-15 by Leinster at the Aviva Stadium, but how did the players perform in the last-16 clash?\n\nNot a great opening from the kick-off but the conditions were awful. Hit hard by Baird and jackaled by him too. Ended up at out-half.\n\nGood tackle on Keenan and an early half break at the start of the new half but really very quiet. The weather and lack of ball saw to that.\n\nGreat tackle out on near the edge with overlap and did so well for his try. Looked bewildered by his yellow card and maybe had a point.\n\nVital poach off Leinster incursion and big tackle on the line on O\u2019Brien in the second half. Couldn\u2019t get enough access to the game.\n\nLost an early high ball to Larmour but a great take later on and shortly afterwards helped the supply for Hume\u2019s score. One kick out on the full.\n\nClearly fired up and forced a knock-on from Keenan. The cross-kick returns to make Hume\u2019s score but then he was forced off with injury.\n\nThere were some good touches and hoisted a few very useful kicks to the sky but was removed less than 10 minutes into the new half.\n\nWasn\u2019t able to prevent Baird from scoring shortly after a scrum penalty. As with his team-mates it was mostly back-foot stuff.\n\nMade the required physical statement and grabbed the try Ulster needed before going off and coming straight back. He put in 26 tackles.\n\nGave away a maul penalty which put Leinster 13-3 in front and may have also been pinged at a scrum. Didn\u2019t come out for the second half.\n\nHe did his bit in preventing Conan from getting the score but his energy was used up trying and failing to keep Leinster at bay.\n\nLooked pretty pumped for this one, but there was little other than back-foot resistance to show for his efforts which was disappointing.\n\nThe flanker made an early impression with a hit on Van der Flier but it wasn\u2019t really a good look for Baird\u2019s try and left early.\n\nHis charge led to Ulster\u2019s first points but there just wasn\u2019t the front-foot he would have wanted. Largely a tackling session for him.\n\nHe really needed a huge game, and you could see him being a nuisance. Couldn\u2019t stop Porter at point blank range. Very little carrying.\n\nThe game was gone\n\nNo impact on the game",

        "content": "Victory is the only thing on Anthony Joshua's mind as he prepares to face Jermaine Franklin at O2 Arena.\n\nHaving lost three of his past five fights (two to Oleksandr Usyk and one to Andy Ruiz) defeat tonight is unthinkable, with the damage to his reputation and career probably terminal. That's not lost on the former heavyweight champion who insists that he doesn't care how he wins, he just wants to get his career and bid for another world title back on track.\n\n\"It is win by any means necessary. We are just here to do a job,\" Joshua said. \"I respect my opponent and may the best man win. One thing he said is he started eating right for this camp, well he's dealing with someone who has been living right from the get go.\n\n\"I have been putting in work from the day I started this business. It's going to be a good fight because he's up against a real one, for sure.\n\n\"The goal is not to make it back to the corner, the goal is to take him out.\"\n\nA first win since 2020 for Joshua could open the door for him finally to face fellow Briton Tyson Fury later this summer.\n\nDeontay Wilder and old rival Dillian Whyte have been mooted as potential opponents and the 33-year-old is eager still to dream big during the latter stages of his professional career.\n\n\"It's big, it's massive. It's a big fight for me, for sure,\" Joshua said. \"I respect my opponent fully and respect everything he's been through and we're here to rock and roll.\n\n\"I respect my supporters as well so I have put in the work, I respect my coach so I want to make sure I get the job done in good finish.\"\n\nStay here for all the pre-fight build up and action with the ringwalks expected from 10.30pm.",

        "content": "Graham Potter has claimed that Chelsea 'can't feel sorry' for themselves after their 2-0 home defeat to Aston Villa.\n\nThe Blues boss watched on as his side were beaten by Unai Emery's visitors thanks to goals from Ollie Watkins and John McGinn either side of half-time.\n\nChelsea seemed to be on the ascension prior to the international break but this result has sent them back down to earth, as the visitors overtook them in the table.\n\nPotter, who will be well aware of the mounting pressure in west London, remained defiant in his post-match interview and suggested they must 'do better'.\n\nSpeaking on Sky Sports, the Blues manager said: 'Well, in both boxes we were second best. The first goal for them is disappointing from our perspective, but there's a lot of good things in the game.\n\n'We have to accept it [the result] and do better,' he said. 'We can't feel sorry for ourselves. We have a fantastic game on Tuesday [home to Liverpool] to put it right.'\n\nThe Blues will be Liverpool's second crunch match within an eight-day period, as the Reds fell to a 4-1 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday afternoon.\n\nChelsea fans will be hoping to see a strong showing from their side on the day, after the meagre performance against Emery's visitors at Stamford Bridge.\n\n'If you look at the stats of the game it was a positive performance, but in terms of the scoreline it's not. We're all really disappointed,' Potter continued.\n\n'Of course. We want to win our home games. There was a positivity about us. The boys gave everything they could.\n\n'It wasn't for a lack of effort, but at the same time we need to manage the small moments better. So the scoreline tells the story.'\n\nThe Blues were somewhat lucky to walk away from the match with just two goals conceded, after the visitors passed up a number of chances in the first-half.\n\nWatkins was presented with a brilliant opportunity which he dragged wide of the mark just minutes before opening the scoring in west London.\n\nThe England forward snuck behind the defence and looped the ball of Kepa Arrizabalaga to stun the home crowd.\n\nAnd then, in the second-half, McGinn curled a long-range effort past the grasps of Chelsea's goalkeeper to double their advantage.\n\nThe result took Villa up to ninth place in the league and saw them leapfrog Potter's side, who remain in 11th.",

Goals from Ollie Watkins and John McGinn either side of half-time gave Villa the lead, taking them up to ninth place in the league and leapfrog Chelsea. Potter remained defiant in his post-match interview and suggested they must 'do better' in order to win their home games. Liverpool will be hoping to see a strong showing from their side on Tuesday, with their second crunch match within an eight-day period coming up against the Reds.",
