        "description": "Kimberly Guilfoyle sent birthday wishes to Ivanka Trump's son Theo, despite the two ladies not getting along.",
        "content": "Trying her best? Kimberly Guilfoyle made every effort to be nice to Ivanka Trump, despite their heated family feud. On Monday, March 27, the TV star, 54, gave a shout-out to Trump's son Theo.\n\n\"We love you, Theo!\" @donaldtrumpjr,\" Guilfoyle re-posted a photo Ivanka, 41, wrote on her Instagram Story. As OK! previously reported, the businesswoman penned a touching message to her son, whom she shares with husband Jared Kushner. \"Happy 7th Birthday to our sweet Theo! You bring so much joy and love into our lives every day with your kind, positive, and energetic spirit. I love you to the moon and back again! May this year bring you laughter, love, adventure and many more trips to the skate park ! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f,\" the mom-of-three, who also shares daughter Arabella and son Joseph, wrote via Instagram.\n\nIvanka and Donald Trump Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e haven't been on the best terms as of late. \u201cIvanka doesn\u2019t trust her because she sees her as a social climber desperate to marry into the family,\" a source revealed. At Tiffany Trump's wedding in November 2022 is when things took a turn for the worse. \u201cKimberly wore black, which rubbed everyone the wrong way,\u201d the source said of the party, where all the other women wore pastels. \u201cKimberly knew the dress code and simply disregarded it, which upset both Tiffany and Ivanka.\"\n\nIvanka also seems to love Vanessa Trump. \u201cShe loves her former sister-in-law, Vanessa,\u201d the source said of Donald Jr.'s ex, whom he divorced after 13 years of marriage in 2018. \u201cThere was hope that they would reconcile, but Kimberly put the kibosh on that.\u201d\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for the OK! newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what OK! has to offer. It\u2019s gossip too good to wait for!\n\nIt seems like Ivanka is trying her best to remain cordial, as she also gave a shout-out to Guilfoyle on her March 9 birthday. \"Happy birthday @kimberlyguilfoyle! Love you!\" Ivanka captioned a photo of Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. together via her Instagram Story. In another slide, she captioned a family shot: \"Looking forward to many more memories and adventures together!\"",

        "content": "Illinois State Sen. Mike Halpin (D-Rock Island) will lead efforts in Springfield to help colleges and universities, according to a news release.\n\nHalpin has been named the chair of the Illinois Senate Higher Education Committee in his first term in the Senate as a nod to the important role the four-year and two-year institutions have in the district he represents that stretches from the Quad Cities down to Macomb, according to the release.\n\nAs chair, Halpin will help lead conversations around investments in MAP grant and capital infrastructure improvements in the state budget and other priorities to help colleges and universities statewide. (MAP grants, which do not need to be repaid, are available to eligible Illinois residents who attend approved Illinois colleges and demonstrate financial need based on the information on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA.) Students are not required to submit high school grades or test scores when applying for a MAP grant.)\n\nHalpin will spend time over the Legislature\u2019s two-week spring break visiting the four-year institutions in a listening tour aimed at helping him connect and learn more about their needs and challenges:\n\nEach visit will feature discussions of different programs of importance at the individual college and university, along with broader talks about the current budget negotiations in Springfield affecting higher education.\n\nHalpin encourages each campus to share with him any needs or concerns they have so he can best advocate for them in the final weeks of the legislative session.\n\n\u201cOur colleges and universities are so resilient, and they have had to battle back from the devastating effects of the 2016-2017 budget standoff in Springfield and the shutdowns from COVID-19,\u201d Halpin said. \u201cI am excited to visit these four excellent institutions to discuss how we can support them and the students they serve.\u201d",

This could prove devastating for Trump, if the jury\u2019s ultimately hear what they hope to. \n\n\n\nAccording to a report put forth by CNN, A federal judge decided that former Vice President Mike Pence must testify before a grand jury regarding discussions he had with the former U.S. President Trump prior to January 6, 2021. This is according to various sources in-the-know about the recent federal court ruling.\n\nThe judge said \u2013 in a ruling that remains under seal \u2013 that Pence can still decline to answer questions regarding when he was serving as president of the Senate for the certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe ruling from chief judge James Boasberg of the US District Court in Washington, DC, adds to more than a dozen wins for special counsel Jack Smith forcing witnesses to testify to the grand jury, and is unusual in that it delves into the powers of the vice presidency as well as separation of powers. Pence still has the ability to appeal.\n\nThe former vice president said his team is \u201cevaluating the court\u2019s decision,\u201d telling Newsmax\u2019s Greta Van Susteren in an interview Tuesday that \u201cthe requirements of my testimony going forward are a subject of our review right now, and I\u2019ll have more to say about that in the days ahead.\u201d",
