        "title": "Max Verstappen fires quit warning as F1 bosses consider more rule changes",
        "description": "Formula 1 chiefs are constantly looking for ways to make the weekend action more exciting and appealing to fans, but the changes have not gone down well with Verstappen",
        "content": "Max Verstappen has threatened to walk away from Formula 1 if the sport's top bosses continue to experiment with the race weekend format.\n\nThe introduction of the Sprint has been the significant change in recent times, with the alternative weekend structure used at three races in each of the last two seasons. This year, the programme has been extended to six Grands Prix of the 23.\n\nVerstappen has already made it clear he is not a fan of the short-form races and prefers the usual weekend format of qualifying on a Saturday and then the race the following day. Not only is the Sprint programme expanding, but further changes are being mooted.\n\nThe first Sprint weekend of 2023 will be in Baku at the end of April. Depending on the outcome of a vote on the subject, the second practice session could be turned into another qualifying session which would decide the grid for the Sprint, while the usual session \u2013 held on the Friday \u2013 would only affect Sunday's Grand Prix.\n\nThe proposed change comes after F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali affirmed his desire to reduce the amount of practice that teams get on race weekends in favour of more competitive sessions. But Verstappen has made it clear he is not on board with such a plan.\n\n\"I'm happy with just the main race,\" he told Portugal's Sport TV. \"I think that's way better for the excitement. I naturally, of course, hope that there won't be too many changes \u2013 otherwise I won't be around for too long.\"\n\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner is more open to changes to the Sprint format in order to \"make it more dynamic\". However, he also had a complaint regarding the decision to hold the first such event of the year in Baku.\n\n\"The reality is it's absolutely ludicrous to be doing the first sprint race of the year in a street race like Azerbaijan,\" he told reporters in Melbourne, adding that he is \"wary\" of the dangers posed by a track which is high-speed and is very narrow in some places.\n\n\"I think from a spectacle point of view, from a fan point of view, it's probably going to be one of the most exciting sprint races of the year. From a cost cap perspective, all you can do is trash your car. And it costs a lot of money around there. So one race is enough in Baku, the fact that we've got two, there could be well some action there.\n\n\"But that's part of the challenge and it's part of the task that we've got. Hopefully, we can tidy up the format for the sprint races coming up, that they are bit more that they are a bit more dynamic. I know that the sporting directors have been working hard on that and hopefully we can get that that finalised.\"",

        "title": "How trainer Joe Gardiner played a key role in Wolves\u2019 glory years",
        "description": "Joe Gardiner was Wolves\u2019 trainer during the greatest period in the club\u2019s history, writes Steve  Gordos.",
        "content": "Gardiner made his Wolves debut at West Bromwich Albion on February 23, 1935, and it was a chastening experience, Wolves, two down after four minutes, losing 5-2. They also conceded two goals in the first five minutes of the second half. Most attention was on inside-forward Bob Iverson, signed from Lincoln two days before, who at least marked his debut with a goal.\n\nAlso in the side, at right-half, was Cullis who had made his debut against Huddersfield Town a week earlier. He and Gardiner would in time bring to Wolves the greatest success the club have known yet as players they just missed out in an exciting side managed by the charismatic Frank Buckley.\n\nIn 1938-9 Wolves would have been champions but, needing to win the final game of the season to pip Arsenal to the title, they lost 1-0 at Sunderland. The following season they were runners-up to Everton and, despite being hot favourites, were beaten 4-1 by Portsmouth in the FA Cup final.\n\nBy then Joe was part of a memorable half-back line with Tom Galley and Cullis. When the Football League met the Scottish League at Molineux in November, 1938, Joe was brought into the team when Bolton\u2019s George Taylor had to withdraw through injury. Skipper Eddie Hapgood, of Arsenal, also withdrew which meant an honour for Joe\u2019s team-mate Cullis who was named captain of the Football League side.\n\nDennis Wilshaw summed him up well: \u201cI think that Joe Gardiner was responsible for a lot of the success that we had. He was the guy you could go up to when you\u2019d just had a rollicking off Stan and he\u2019d comfort you and he would say something good and he\u2019d lift you.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper Malcolm Finlayson recalled how Joe would help him in the gym area below the Waterloo Road stand. \u201cHe\u2019d be throwing ball as at you off the wall to make angles and he must have got browned off but he\u2019d keep doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe was a great foil for Stan,\u201d said Roy Swinbourne, the two-goal hero of the famous floodlit win over Hungarian maestros Honved. \u201cIf Stan had a go at someone, Joe would take them on one side and smooth things out. He knew his football. We would sneak off to the car par for a game and there would be one or two injuries through playing there. Joe would come along and drag us off but he\u2019d laugh about it. He was a lovely chap.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe WAS the Wolves in many ways,\u201d said Norman Deeley, goalscoring hero of the 1960 FA Cup final. \u201cHe was there from morning \u2019til night. He was there if you wanted to go back to do some extra training in the afternoon or work on your faults with you. He was a quiet man who just got on with the job. Joe was placid and the ideal man to put up with someone as intense as Stan.\u201d",

He and Gardiner would bring to Wolves the greatest success they have yet to be known yet, but were often overlooked by the charismatic Frank Buckley. Joe was part of a memorable half-back line with Tom Galley and Cullis, and was also a key player in the famous floodlit win over Hungarian maestros Honved. He was a quiet man who just got on with the job and was a great foil for Stan, a two-goal hero of the 1960 FA Cup final.",

        "title": "Vincent Kompany can make four exciting signings if he joins Tottenham",
        "description": "Vincent Kompany is reportedly among the favourites for the vacant Tottenham managerial job.",
        "content": "Vincent Kompany is reportedly among the names in contention to take over at Tottenham this summer when Daniel Levy will seek to complete the appointment of a new manager to turn the club's fortunes around. The highly-rated Belgian tactician has made waves with Championship leaders Burnley this season, totally transforming their impressive brand of attacking football whilst firing the Clarets within touching distance of promotion back to the Premier League.\n\nKompany is said to have made a real impression with his personality and managerial nous but his eye for talent is arguably what stands out most having made a number of exceptional signings. That is exactly what Tottenham need given the amount of cash they have wasted in recent transfer windows. And although Kompany's proposed move to Tottenham is far from a foregone conclusion, he would be an appointment that would signal a change of direction from Spurs. With that in mind, Express Sport analyses four hypothetical signings Kompany could consider making if he was to succeed Antonio Conte at the end of the season.\n\nTottenham are continuing to experience problems at left-back despite the signing of Ivan Perisic and it remains a department where extra quality is required. Maatsen looks a fine prospect and although signing him would involve negotiating with Chelsea, he is a player with huge potential. The 21-year-old has been exceptional for the Clarets this term, bagging four goals and registering six assists for Kompany at Turf Moor. He has all the makings of a Premier League player and he is likely to be playing in the top-flight next season, whichever club he is playing for. Maatsen is the kind of signing Spurs need, a young player who is ready to step up at the top level.\n\nLavia is one of the Premier League's unpolished gems and Arsenal and Chelsea are said to be monitoring his development at Southampton. Kompany has the unique Belgian connection with the player and could make him an integral player in Spurs' midfield, which is in desperate need of a revamp. The Southampton starlet is yet to fulfil his potential but given Chelsea tried to land him for big money last summer immediately after signing for the Saints, it's clear he is rated amongst the Premier League's top sides. Additionally, if Southampton go down this season, he could be available at a cut-price. Kompany has the intelligence to embed these young players straight into his side as opposed to letting them rot on the bench like other recent Spurs managers.\n\nVranckx is another top Belgian midfield prospect, who is beginning to make a huge impression on loan at AC Milan. The 20-year-old is rated among the best Belgian prospects of the next generation and Kompany would surely love to nurture his talent. Unfortunately, he is currently out of reach at Burnley with the player on course to sign for AC Milan permanently from Wolfsburg. But again, there is arguably no better manager for Vranckx in world football than the former Manchester City captain.",

        "description": "\u201cThanks for occupying the back pages this week, takes the pressure off a bit.\u201d",
        "content": "The two clubs are at different ends of the Premier League, but perhaps this will be the reminder that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy needs that events can take a turn for the worse quickly in troubled waters.\n\nBut the club had not been run well for several seasons with too many managerial changes and not enough joined up thinking on the recruitment side.\n\nHis successor, Rafa Benitez, fell out with the club\u2019s director of football, Marcel Brands, and everything began to unravel at pace from then on, with the club changing manager mid-season for the past two campaigns.\n\nIn February last year, in one of the more bizarre post-match interviews this job has thrown up, in the pouring rain after a 1-0 defeat to Burnley, Conte all but resigned on camera before settling on the view that the club needed to \u201cmake an assessment\u201d of everybody at the club.\n\nAn unsteady truce between club and board has existed ever since but after failing to beat Southampton a fortnight ago Conte finally let rip and virtually sacked himself with an astonishing outburst about Spurs and its recent history.\n\nBoth managers were allowed to spend far more than Pochettino, but the club have struggled to shake off the tag of being an easy touch when the going gets tough.\n\nYet despite Conte\u2019s removal, Spurs\u2019 season was not in huge trouble. Cristian Stellini and Ryan Mason remain in the dugout and there is all to play for in the fight for a top four finish.\n\nSpurs were caught off guard by this announcement and have been trying to seek clarification from Fifa before making any comments about Paratici\u2019s future. He is effectively redundant, or at least on a long period of gardening leave.\n\nConversations have been taking place high up in boardroom circles for some time about who might replace Paratici if he is found guilty by the Prisma investigation taking place in Italy in next month.",

        "title": "Man Utd takeover LIVE - Glazers' price slammed as Ten Hag urged to sell players",
        "description": "The race to buy Premier League club Manchester United from the Glazers drags on - with the likes of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and Sir Jim Ratcliffe submitting bids",
        "content": "Keep up to date with all the latest information by sticking with us here...\n\nOn the pitch, Erik ten Hag's side are back in action on Sunday - when they take on top-four rivals Newcastle at St James' Park. The suspended Casemiro will not play.\n\nQatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe are still viewed as the two frontrunners - even though both have failed to meet the Glazers' \u00a36billion valuation of the club. US hedge fund Elliott Management are also in the mix, although they want to become minority shareholders to work alongside the Glazers.\n\nAs the Premier League returns, it remains unclear who - if anyone - will persuade the Glazers to sell Manchester United .\n\nErik ten Hag needs to rid of ten Manchester United stars this summer including Jadon Sancho, according to former player Paul Parker. The right-back played at Old Trafford in the '90s but has delivered a scathing verdict on a bulk of the current squad, despite them ending their trophy drought which had dated back to 2017. Ten Hag has allowed optimism to grow in his debut year with the club poised to return to the Champions League. He's in the midst of reshaping his squad in Manchester, but several of his regulars this term have been deemed surplus to requirements by Parker. Among those is Sancho, who is only into his second year at the club and underwent a specific training programme in the winter.\n\nGraham Potter has hailed Mason Mount as a \"top professional\" as he deals with injury and speculation over his Chelsea future. The midfielder withdrew from the recent England squad as he dealt with a bone injury but is pushing for minutes this weekend as the Blues take on Aston Villa. Mount has only scored three times this term with his influence on games not what it was in a struggling side. There has been huge investment and, as a result, change at Stamford Bridge which has cast doubt over Mount's future. The player is in the midst of negotiating a new deal, which could yet end with him leaving west London with both Liverpool and Manchester United keen on his services.\n\nDavid de Gea maintains he \"loves\" Manchester United despite turning down their opening contract offer. The goalkeeper's deal with the Red Devils will soon expire and he and the club are in the midst of negotiating an extension. De Gea signed a lucrative deal in the summer of 2019that made him one of the Premier League's top earners and he accepts that he'll have to take a pay cut to stay put. Despite that he felt the first offer put to him was too low and, as the club's No 1, he still wants to be paid appropriately. There is a willingness to reach an agreement with the goalkeeper looking to extend his 12-year stay at Old Trafford as he looks to silence the outside noise regarding his future.\n\nErik ten Hag insists talks over a new deal for Marcus Rashford are \"an internal process\" with the Manchester United manager focused on on-field matters. United triggered a one-year extension to Rashford's deal back in December, keeping him at Old Trafford until the end of the 2023-24 season. They are keen to keep the England star on board for the long-term, though, and opened talks over a fresh deal after he returned from World Cup duty. Ten Hag was asked about the situation as he spoke to the media ahead of United's weekend trip to Newcastle, one of three games in a week for the Red Devils. However, the Dutchman made clear his task was getting results on the field. \"It's an internal process,\" Ten Hag said. \"We focus on winning games, also planning for the future so in the back we're working on that. \"It's about agents, it's about football director John Murtough, Rashy and I are focusing on performing.\"\n\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag appears to have solved the Bruno Fernandes issue that Paul Scholes claimed was a problem last season. The Portugal international can often divide opinion as a result of his on-pitch conduct and tendency to make both officials and his team-mates well aware when he is frustrated with them. However, that was not what Scholes took issue with back in the second-half of last season. What left the United legend frustrated was how often Fernandes seemed to veer away from the tactics and end up in different areas of the pitch where he wasn't able to influence as much as normal. Scholes lost patience with the United vice-captain following a 1-1 home draw against Southampton back when the Red Devils were under the reign of Ralf Rangnick. Speaking while on punditry duty for BT Sport, Scholes suggested Fernandes was becoming a headache for then-boss Rangnick.",

Ten Hag insists talks over a new deal for Marcus Rashford are \"an internal process\" with the Manchester United manager focused on on-field matters. The issue that Paul Scholes claimed was a problem last season can often divide United team-mates and their former manager.",

        "description": "Alan Richardson says Worcester\u2019s pre-season preparations have been difficult due to the weather \u2013 but successful sides are the ones who adapt to those challenges.",
        "content": "The Pears are due to start their County Championship campaign next week when they make the trip to the County Ground to take on Derby.\n\nBut the volume of cricket Worcester have had outdoors to prepare for the clash has been seriously limited due to wet weather experienced across the UK in March.\n\nRichardson is now head coach at New Road outfit after taking over from his predecessor Alex Gidman at the end of last season. But his side have not had it easy as they prepare for this campaign.\n\nThey managed to play one day at Edgbaston last week, but since then they have struggled to get outdoors, with training sessions going back to Malvern College due to the wet conditions.\n\nRichardson says his side have got enough cricket in the bag and will try to adapt to the lack of preparation.\n\n\u201cIt has been a challenge, but it has been similar throughout the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA real aim for us last year was to try and get as many guys away, overseas playing club cricket in the winter. Some of those guys got loads of cricket under their belts so I am really comfortable with those guys.\n\n\u201cFor everyone else, we started in Malvern in January, so guys have been playing cricket now for two months \u2013 yes it is indoor but they have been getting through their skills.\n\n\u201cWe were fortunate enough to go to Desert Springs for eight days on a camp, we feel like we are in a pretty good place. If we get poor weather here, it is probably poor everywhere else, and it is the same with every county coach I speak to, they are scratching their heads too about how they are going to get enough cricket.\n\n\u201cThe volume of cricket we had over the course of winter will hold us in good stead. Is it ideal preparation? Not always, but how often is it perfect? I think the teams that do will well are the teams who will adapt to those challenges.\u201d",

        "content": "Curtin, who has been at Monmore since 2010, has enjoyed a healthy share of success in both the Open race scene and graded ranks over the last few months.\n\nThis evening gives Curtin the opportunity to keep up the momentum as he has four runners on the card, and he said: \u201cI think this is potentially the best kennel of dogs I\u2019ve had for six or seven years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one or two dogs ticking away there on the Open scene and younger dogs who have already made the top grade at Monmore, so there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked to work with young, raw dogs and see if I can realise their potential.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of changes in greyhound racing over the years but have managed to come through it \u2013 always with a full kennels and a healthy strength of dogs running at Monmore Green.\n\nOpen racing is due to resume at Monmore next weekend while this summer, two Category One competitions will come to a head on the same night as the Gold Cup and Summer Stayers finals both take place on August 26.\n\nCurtin, who had Olga recently reach the Premier Greyhound Racing Golden Jacket final at Crayford, already has half on eye on those.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been quiet in recent years with the Open races, but Olga has been the flag-bearer for us this year,\u201d added Curtin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got others in the pipeline, too, who will be ready later this year. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have a team of six of seven to go out Open racing with in the middle of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at the Summer Stayers and maybe the Gold Cup as well here at Monmore if we can get some more established dogs over four bends.",

        "description": "Dennis Hauger took victory in mixed conditions in the Formula 2 sprint race in Melbourne, enduring a safety car restart as rain proved difficult for many.",
        "content": "The MP Motorsport driver led from lights-to-flag to secure his third series victory and his first since moving to the reigning champions for 2023.\n\nDespite a mid-race safety car and further rainfall, Hauger was able to hold off Jak Crawford and Kush Maini, with the two rookies completing the podium for Hitech and Campos Racing respectively.\n\nA wet-to-dry track and intermittent showers ended several drivers\u2019 races prematurely, with Enzo Fittipaldi and Ralph Boschung both out on the reconnaissance lap having been caught out by wet patches.\n\nFittipaldi spuan at Turn 9, crashing into the barrier, before Boschung had a similar fate, albeit stalling rather than making contact, with both drivers unable to start the race.\n\nMaini also spun on the way to the grid, but was able to keep going and line up third behind poleman Hauger and Crawford, as the start was delayed by five minutes to retrieve Fittipaldi\u2019s stricken Rodin Carlin car.\n\nHauger held firm off the line, with movement further back as Prema rookie Ollie Bearman passed former team-mate Arthur Leclerc (DAMS) for fourth.\n\nTurn 9 saw several tussles, with Crawford attempting to take the lead before backing out while Leclerc made it back past Bearman and Martins took advantage to sweep into fifth.\n\nThe following lap, Ayumu Iwasa had a huge lock up into Turn 1 in his DAMS-run car, suffering a puncture and forcing him into the pits.\n\nRodin Carlin driver Zane Maloney made it past Formula 3 rival Bearman for sixth at Turn 11 on lap four, with Leclerc looking to make a move on Maini for third on lap five before holding his place.\n\nThe Monegasque driver took his chance three laps later, making it past the Campos driver at Turn 10, but Maini got back past the following corner to hold his podium position.\n\nA fierce four-car fight came on lap 13, with Maloney, Martins and Hadjar fighting over fifth while the Prema pair scrapped over the final points-paying position. Maloney emerged ahead in fifth, with Martins, Hadjar, Vesti and Bearman close behind.\n\nThe safety car was deployed on lap 14 after Juan Manuel Correa tagged home favourite Jack Doohan from behind at Turn 3, sending the Virtuosi driver into a spin from which he was unable to recover. The Van Amersfoort Racing driver, who returned to F2 this season, was handed a 10-second penalty for the incident.\n\nSeveral drivers gambled on pitting for wet tyres under the safety car as rainfall was reported in some areas of the circuit, Martins and Theo Pourchaire among them.\n\nThe intermission wasn\u2019t without action, with Correa spinning in a similar incident to that he caused with Doohan, and as the safety car was about to end, Brad Benavides headed into the wall at Turn 13 in his PHM Racing by Charouz car, extending it for another lap.\n\nThe safety car ended on the penultimate lap, with Correa making it past 2022 runner-up Pourchaire for 12th on the restart.\n\nThe pre-season favourite struggled to adapt to his wet tyres on a drying track, sweeping across the gravel at Turn 1 and dropping down the order before retiring.\n\nBearman passed Vesti for seventh at Turn 9 on the final tour, with Martins claiming 15th from Stanek.\n\nLeclerc finished in fourth, with Maloney and Hadjar in fifth and sixth, ahead of the Prema pair of Bearman and Vesti, who rounded out the points.",

Despite a mid-race safety car and further rainfall, Hauger was able to hold off Jak Crawford and Kush Maini, with the two rookies completing the podium for Hitech and Campos Racing respectively. Enzo Fittipaldi and Ralph Boschung both out on the reconnaissance lap having been caught out by wet patches, while Prema rookie Ollie Bearman passed former team-mate Arthur Leclerc for fourth and fifth. A fierce four-car fight came on lap 13, with Maloney, Martins and Hadjar fighting over fifth while the Prema pair scrapped over the final points-paying position. The safety car was deployed on lap 14 after Juan Manuel Correa tagged home favourite Jack Doohan from behind at Turn 3, sending the Virtuosi driver into a spin from which he was unable to recover.",

        "description": "Casemiro will miss Man United's next three Premier League fixtures after being sent-off prior to the international break.",
        "content": "Five weeks after scoring the opener in Manchester United's Carabao Cup final triumph over Newcastle United at Wembley, Casemiro will be forced to take up a watching brief when the two sides meet again on Sunday.\n\nUnited's trip to St James' Park will mark the second game of the Brazilian midfielder's four-match ban, following his second red card of the season during last month's goalless draw with Southampton. He was dismissed for a first half challenge on Saints midfielder Carlos Alcaraz, marking his second dismissal in just three Premier League appearances.\n\nHe has, of course, been one of United's star performers this season, playing a vital role in the club's transformation under manager Erik ten Hag. The \u00a360million the Reds paid for him has looked more and more of a bargain as the season has developed, meaning he ought to be a shoo-in for anyone tasked with selecting a Premier League Team of the Season over the next few weeks.\n\nREAD MORE: Who United should sign if they can't seal Harry Kane deal\n\nHowever, his latest suspension means that he will play no part in what promises to be a pivotal week in United's season and their quest for a top-four finish. After facing Newcastle on Sunday, the Reds have back-to-back home games against Brentford and Everton on Wednesday evening and next Saturday lunchtime, respectively.\n\nAlthough United have become used to a demanding schedule this season, three league matches in just seven days promises to take its toll, particularly when Ten Hag is not blessed with options in midfield. It is a situation that is not helped by the absence of Christian Eriksen. He has been sidelined since January with an ankle injury and is not ready to make his return just yet, despite making encouraging progress.\n\nWorking in tandem with Casemiro, Eriksen quickly formed a blossoming midfield partnership with the former Madrid man, with both of them central to the way Ten Hag likes his team to play. Although Casemiro, since Eriksen has been assigned to the treatment room, has held the fort well in his absence, United have looked lost and unorganised when their Brazilian talisman has also been absent.\n\nWhen Casemiro was suspended for three matches during February, United, despite taking seven points from a possible nine from their two meetings with Leeds United and clash with Leicester City, lacked control in midfield, were uninspiring and required in-game tactical changes to contribute to securing positive results. It was a similar tale when United faced Arsenal in January when Casemiro missed out through suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season against Crystal Palace a few days earlier, only on that occasion the result the Reds wanted was missing.\n\nBut despite a concerning pattern emerging about United's below-par performances when the 31-year-old has been missing, Ten Hag, ahead of the Reds' 3-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Fulham prior to the international break, played down suggestions that his side are too reliant on the defensive-midfielder and do not perform as well when he is not on the pitch.\n\n\"We have had many more games without Casemiro,\" said Ten Hag. \"We have done really well without Casemiro. Against Arsenal, the two [fixtures] against Leeds.\n\n\"I remember all the games and I think we did really well without Casemiro at the start of the season. I want to have Casemiro available because he has a huge impact, but we also won many games without Casemiro and we have to do it with other players.\"\n\nHowever, United demonstrated in the aforementioned win over Fulham that they simply cannot cope without Casemiro's presence in the engine room. United were second-best for 75 minutes against the Cottagers and almost certainly only progressed to the semi-finals because of the Londoners choosing to press the self-destruct button and lose their heads after Willian blocked Jadon Sancho's goal-bound effort with his arm.\n\nUnited, who started with a midfield trio of Marcel Sabitzer, Scott McTominay and Bruno Fernandes that afternoon, lacked control in midfield and were outclassed by their opponents in that department. Joao Palhinha dictated proceedings and reminded United that they do not have a dominative midfielder in reserve.\n\nUnited clearly regress without Casemiro and their tally of four Premier League defeats when he has not started this season proves that. By contrast, they have lost just twice when he has started, confirming how big an influence he has.\n\nTherefore, this forthcoming week, while Casemiro concludes his four-match ban, will represent United's last opportunity to justify Ten Hag's comments and prove they can play well without him. If their performances are underwhelming and scrappy again, it will only further highlight his importance.\n\u2022 None All the latest United news, views and transfer updates\n\u2022 None United need Jadon Sancho to rise to Paul Scholes' challenge\n\u2022 None United's next six fixtures compared with their rivals\n\u2022 None The plans United are considering for Old Trafford\n\u2022 None United have a new attacking weapon to unleash",

The trip to St James' Park will mark the second game of the four-match ban, following his second red card of the season during last month's goalless draw with Southampton. Despite his absence, United have looked lost and unorganised when their Brazilian talisman has also been absent, and Ten Hag played down suggestions that his side are too reliant on the defensive-midfielder and do not perform as well when he is not on the pitch. United demonstrated in their 3-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Fulham prior to the international break that they simply cannot cope without Casemira's presence in the engine room. If United do not have a problem without him, they can prove their performances are underwhelming and scrappy.",

        "title": "Arteta faces Jesus conundrum as Partey returns vs Leeds",
        "description": "Mikel Arteta has one big decision to make ahead of this afternoon's Premier League fixture against Leeds United.",
        "content": "Mikel Arteta has a close to full-strength squad available to him heading into this afternoon\u2019s Premier League fixture against Leeds United. William Saliba is still unavailable, but Thomas Partey has been cleared for the game after picking up a \u2018small injury\u2019 during the international break. The main conundrum Arteta faces is whether to start Gabriel Jesus or Leandro Trossard up top. Here, Express Sport takes a look at Arsenal\u2019s expected line-up for their 3pm kick-off at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nAaron Ramsdale will almost certainly start between the sticks against Leeds. The English shot-stopper was denied a thirteenth clean sheet of the season by a scrappy Jeffrey Schlupp finish last time out against Crystal Palace. And will do everything in his power to ensure the same doesn\u2019t happen again today. Leeds though have been in good scoring form as of late with six goals from their last two matches including four away at Wolves. It will likely be an unchanged back four from Arsenal\u2019s 4-1 win against Palace with Saliba still out with a back injury. When asked if the Frenchman will play again this season, Arteta told assembled media on Thursday: \"Yeah I am very hopeful, and he is as well. Back injuries are a bit tricky and how they evolve with the load that you put in certain areas. Let's push it and see how he copes with that. He's so willing to be back in the team.\"\n\nRob Holding is expected to slot in again ahead of Jakub Kiwior who is still adjusting to life at the Emirates. Meanwhile, Ben White, Gabriel Megahales and Oleksandr Zinchenko have been staples of Arteta\u2019s defensive line and will probably remain in the starting XI today. Thomas Partey is expected to be fit despite having to sit out of Ghana\u2019s game against Angola on Monday. The 29-year-old was absent from Arsenal training earlier this week, but sources close to the player claim that it was only precautionary. If he is indeed fit, then he will no doubt start. Granit Xhaka and Martin Odegaard are also expected to keep their places in the side as they have done for the majority of this season.\n\nWhen it comes to the front three it is a little bit more difficult to predict Arteta\u2019s choices. Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka will more than likely start on the wings, but he will have to choose between Trossard and Jesus down the middle. Trossard has looked excellent down the centre in recent games while Jesus made the position his own before being sidelined by injury. The Brazilian is due 90 minutes of football so we will go with him.",

        "summary": "Mikel Arteta has a close to full-strength squad available to him for this afternoon's Premier League fixture against Leeds United. William Saliba is still unavailable, but Thomas Partey has been cleared for the game after picking up a \u2018small injury\u2019 during the international break. The main conundrum Arteta faces is whether to start Gabriel Jesus or Leandro Trossard up top. Rob Holding is expected to slot in again ahead of Jakub Kiwior who is still adjusting to life at the Emirates. Ben White, Gabriel Megahales and Oleksandr Zinchenko have been staples of Arteta\u2019s defensive line and will probably remain in the starting XI today. Granit Xhaka and Martin Odegaard are also expected to keep their places in the side as they have done for the majority of this season.",
